# copy-packages-relative-path

A VSCode extension which allows you to copy the path to a file relative to a
`packages/` directory. This makes absolutely importing files in a lerna-style
monorepo easier.

This extension exists to make contributions to Instana's user interface codebase
easier.

## Keybinds

By default the extension binds `ctrl+alt+c` (`cmd+ctrl+c` for MacOS) to the 
`copy-packages-relative-path.copy` command.
